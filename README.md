# **PicoSens** ‚Äì Industrial Remote Sensor Dashboard with Raspberry Pi Pico W

**PicoSens** is a compact, Wi-Fi-enabled monitoring system designed for industrial environments. It interfaces with industry-standard 4‚Äì20‚ÄØmA current loop sensors to measure critical parameters like temperature, pressure, flow, and current. Using a Raspberry Pi Pico W, PicoSens provides real-time data visualization via a responsive web dashboard, logs historical readings, and supports configurable alerts to detect anomalies and prevent equipment failure.
